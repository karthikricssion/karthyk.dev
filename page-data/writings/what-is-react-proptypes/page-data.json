But when working with complex react application things get messy and harder to know what props available in components. It is time consuming activity. By using proptypes we can create a dictionary of props that used inside the component with its types. Since its a run time typechecker we will notice the errors in browser console. We can find different validators <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html#proptypes\">here</a>. </p>\n<h3>defaultProps</h3>\n<p>By creating a dictionary of props using proptypes, We solve the time consuming problem. But what if we don't pass the attribute or props to the child component that are defined in proptypes and required? Instead of setting empty value to attribute we use defaultprops to set default values that is required by child component.</p>\n<p>Here is the example of proptypes and default proptypes</p>\n<pre><code>import React from 'react';\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\n\nconst Button = (props) => {\n    return (\n        &#x3C;button title={props.label}>\n            {props.children}\n        &#x3C;/button>\n    )\n}\n\nButton.propTypes = {\n    label: PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n    children: PropTypes.element.isRequired\n}\n\nButton.defaultProps = {\n    label: 10,\n    children: &#x3C;div>Hello world!&#x3C;/div>\n}\n\nexport default Button\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2020","title":"What is the use of proptypes in ReactJS","tags":["tech","fundamentals","reactjs"],"author":{"name":"Karthikeyan Rajendran","url":"https://twitter.com/karthik_dot_js"},"category":"learning"},"excerpt":"'prop-types' is a run time typechecking of props.
