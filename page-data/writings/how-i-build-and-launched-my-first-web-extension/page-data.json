I took my note, started listing out problems and the solutions I used at that time. By analyzing I found a simple problem that can be solved on the usability of temp-email extensions.</p>\n<h3>ðŸ™ˆ Problem</h3>\n<p>I use to test a lot of products for gathering ideas and motivation, I get spammed a lot. And while testing my product modules like registration, emails I need a quick inbox where I can access email in-ease to test out my emails. Tried various quick extension plugins, Most of the plugins either takes me to a new tab or their website.</p>\n<h3>ðŸ’» Develop</h3>\n<p>I don't have prior knowledge of developing web extensions. I googled and found that <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions\">MDN Firefox web extension docs</a>. I followed with getting started and tried out their examples. I tried to modify the codes and play around with them. Then I started to work out a small idea in order to explore more I developed a simple extension called <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/responsify-viewer/\">Responsify viewer</a>. It gave an idea about how to use 'content script', 'browser local storage', and 'manifest file'. </p>\n<p>I thought to get started with developing the app extension. I took my notebook again started drawing the user flows, UI of the views, and list the functionalities related to the UI's. I chose VueJS framework for developing the extension. Research and found a generator call <a href=\"https://github.com/adambullmer/vue-cli-plugin-browser-extension\">vue-cli-browser-extension</a>. Framed a plan with the following todos</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give a name</li>\n<li>Design extension logo </li>\n<li>Design icons for the app</li>\n<li>CSS Loader</li>\n<li>Build HTML layouts</li>\n<li>Add VueJs to the project</li>\n<li>Split the HTML into Vue components</li>\n<li>work on icons for all resolution</li>\n<li>Add JS functionalities</li>\n<li>Build a website and write content myself</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>â›³ MVP</h4>\n<p>It took me 5 days to develop the application. It came well. I did most of the development testing manually, didn't create any test cases because I haven't done it. I shared the project with my dev friends and asked them for their feedback on the usage. Meanwhile, I chose versoly website builder for building the website. It took me just 4hrs to work on the layouts and contents and then share with the same people for feedback. I was surprised with feedbacks they gave and I started to work on it and updated both the app and website. The product is ready to publish.</p>\n<h3>â›µ Ship the product</h3>\n<p>I was planned to publish extension for firefox and chrome. I followed the steps and submitted for review and get approval. After 1 day got a mail from firefox that my extension that app is added to their gallery and another mail in the next few hours from google stating I need to add a privacy page to my website. I worked out with a simple privacy page and re-submitted for review. It took nearly 4 days to get approved for the public. </p>\n<p>Hurray! what a journey it was to work on from an idea to publish. Next comes the most important part <strong><em>How to market the product?</em></strong> Where I wasn't successful in that, but am still figuring it out away. I will write a post on <em>Success or failure</em> soon. </p>\n<p>I am sharing the extension website link and addon links here, Try out! and I am open to any feedback and comments. </p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://tempemailify.versoly.page/\">https://tempemailify.versoly.page/</a> <br>\nChrome Addon: <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tempemailify-an-temporary/odnbnmfjpeiegeabmjefkbioiblkceha?hl=en-GB&#x26;authuser=0\">Link</a> <br>\nFirefox Addon: <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tempemailify/\">Link</a>  </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 16, 2021","title":"ðŸš€ How I build and launched my first web extension","tags":["product","idea","browser extension"],"author":{"name":"Karthikeyan Rajendran","url":"https://twitter.com/karthik_dot_js"},"category":"product"},"excerpt":"P.S: This was my first side project to get published  ðŸ’¡ Ideation It was a Saturday evening having my cup of coffee, thinking about the problems I use to face while building web applications.
