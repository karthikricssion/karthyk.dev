Marketing is one of the important parts of any business. As I have built and released a SAAS product name [yekaliva](https://yekaliva.ai/) in our [start up](https://positivenaick.com/). We were looking out for lots of companies that provide leads, even though I wasn't happy with that move. Eventually being the creator of the product which I have a personal touch with it. So I spend a few days on marketing after finishing the minor release of our product. Here are some thoughts which I have gathered not so long list on our product perspective.

## We shouldn't use
"we have the best conversation flow/working model to assist your visitors".

## What we should use 
- We thing bringing A.I to your website gives a meaningful and extra power to empower your website visitors with much knowledge about your company and business with the effective human-like conversational flow.
- We designed the product with more comfortable UI that helps you to create, train, test and integrate the bot more easily
Mass marketing works only when its 15% share on the whole market, Then only it's considered as a success.
