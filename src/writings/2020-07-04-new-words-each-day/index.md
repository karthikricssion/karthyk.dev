I am going to take a step ahead to improve my vocabulary. Sounds like a goal right? Lolz, I have been thinking a lot about taking note of the new words in google docs or keep or a note-taking app. The result has always been ended up not following it or not even thinking about it. I am going to dedicate a space in my blog, to keep track of my learnings. I will stick with it and keep updating whenever possible.

1. mulling - Think about
2. elusive - Difficult to find
