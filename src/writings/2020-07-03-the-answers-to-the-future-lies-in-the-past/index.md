Being a developer I have never had, hmmm lets say, I never spend time on get to know the why's of all languages, tools that I come accross personally for development. I use too always focus on the end product. Being that it helps me to drive myself push to break the impossiblitiese and learn things faster than I could imagine. 

Don't mistake me that I'm getting lost in thoughts by going back. Currently I am trying to restart and refresh my career so that I won't be in the same state of where I am right now in near future. I am writting this to pour out my thoughts that wandering over my mind that distracts me

But why now? what happened to me? why such questions are popping up in my head and feel like I pushed somewhere far behined or down the line in my career? I am trying to figureout which path drive me here? 

In order to figure out whats are my actual hobbies, strengths, skills. I decided to question myself for all the actions and decissions that have taken so far.

- Did I learn subjects by understanding in depth and connectivity?
- Is choosing computer science @ higher secondary was right?
- Let's not skip this "Why did I choose engineering?"
- Why I wasn't able to grasp things?
- What were my thoughts at times?
- Did I had a vision for myself? what about right now?
- What I didn't focus on sports?
- Why was I being so honest with everyone?
- Why did I fell in love and why did I broke up?
- Why I didn't realize the concept of being dept free?
- What were the things I used to do apart from book worming?
- Why I am pushing my life so hard?
- Why you trust people?
- Why you werent concious on yourself, especially health?
